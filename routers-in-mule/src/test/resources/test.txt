conclusion: Variable Propagation in Scatter-Gather
Every route starts with the same initial variable values. Modifications to a variable within a specific route do not affect other 
routes. So, if a variable is added or modified in one route, then, after aggregation, the value is defined by that route. 
If a variable is added or modified by more than one route, the value is added to a list of all the values defined for that 
variable within all the routes.
